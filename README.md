☕ Brew Haven Café – Real Business Website Project
🌍 Real-World Freelance Simulation | Full Stack Internship – Task 3


📌 Project Overview

This project is a real-world business website simulation built as if I were a freelance developer pitching to an actual local café.

Instead of creating an imaginary app, this project focuses on solving a real business problem:

Helping a local café build a strong online presence and attract more customers.

The website is created for:

Brew Haven Café
A cozy coffee shop targeting students, freelancers, and young professionals.

🎯 Business Problem

Currently, Brew Haven Café only uses Instagram for promotion.

This creates several limitations:

Customers cannot easily find menu & pricing

No professional online presence

No Google search visibility

Hard to locate opening hours & address

Reduced trust compared to competitors with websites

💡 Proposed Solution

A modern, mobile-friendly professional website that:

✔ Builds trust
✔ Makes the café look premium
✔ Showcases menu clearly
✔ Displays location & contact information
✔ Attracts new walk-in customers
✔ Improves online visibility

💼 Freelancer Business Pitch (Client-Focused)

If I were presenting this to the café owner, I would say:

Brew Haven Café already has great products and ambience.
But today, customers search online before visiting.
Without a website, potential customers may choose competitors.

This website will:

Increase customer trust

Improve Google visibility

Make menu & pricing easily accessible

Help new customers discover your café

Strengthen brand identity

Provide competitive advantage

In simple terms:

This website helps turn online searches into real customers walking into your café.

📈 Business Impact

With this website, Brew Haven Café can:

Attract students searching “Best café near me”

Showcase ambience for freelancers

Promote seasonal offers

Share location instantly

Appear more professional than competitors

This project simulates how developers create real value for businesses — not just write code.

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced:

Building for real business needs

Designing with business goals in mind

Writing conversion-focused content

Structuring websites for usability

Thinking like a freelancer

Delivering client-ready presentation
